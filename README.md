# WP Cycle Content Tutorial
This is a custom plugin that will dynamically cycle through content using a modal.
The tutorial is currently a work in progress and I will make updates here
as I complete it.

The `master` branch is intended to be the starting point. I intend to use other
branches for completing the plugin.

## Starter Plugin
This plugin is built off of the start plugin I've been working on. You can find it here: https://github.com/efuller/wp-starter-plugin
